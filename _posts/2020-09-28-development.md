Hey. Another day.

I opened Atom and found what I wanted here: View - Developer - Open in DevMode. It makes me thnik - am I developer? Or what else? Coder? Webdesigner? Desiner sounds like "something with graphics", I do not feel like doing something with graphics (very little). So? Whatever. But - it might be useful to know how is that called what am I doing. Later I might try to find out.

I am developing new WP Theme. So, for the moment I might be developer-begginer. Question of identity is solved, so I can continue in my work.

Another news form Atom: View - Toggle Soft Wrap =) Nice =)

38:26 - connection intension - doesn't work, I don't wanna go back to find where is the mistake... see-no-evil

I uninstalled French keyboard setting (laguages). Maybe one day it will be back. But now, it's enought to swich between CS/EN to code. Thrird option became to confusing for me. Too much. Au revoir!
