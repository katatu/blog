Hey. Another day.

I opened Atom and found what I wanted here: View - Developer - Open in DevMode. It makes me thnik - am I developer? Or what else? Coder? Webdesigner? Desiner sounds like "something with graphics", I do not feel like doing something with graphics (very little). So? Whatever. But - it might be useful to know how is that called what am I doing. Later I might try to find out.

I am developing new WP Theme. So, for the moment I might be developer-begginer. Question of identity is solved, so I can continue in my work.
