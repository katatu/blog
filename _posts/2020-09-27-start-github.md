I thought I have been using Github already and I was surprised I couldn't log in. All right, I registed and started with brand new space for my work.

I went through Git Hub Lab - Introduction and than Git Hub Pages to create this awesome blog. ;)

I have done this just in between waiting for download and than instalation of MySQL. The main task today is start creating my own wordpress theme using bootstrap. It seem more complicated than I expected :D Whatever. I managed to download
- wordpress itself (I have had it already)
- underscores theme (I have had it already)
- bootsrap somethnig
- font awesome
- tether (eventhough I have no idea what it is, they say bootstrap needs it; ok than)
- MAMP (cool!)
- MySQL - finally, I have done something wrong so for second time =) with a little help of someone from youtube video, speaking lovely indian language and making sure a few times that everybody understood which link he means, nice nice, I hade so much fun

I'm gonna continue learning something in Lab https://lab.github.com/ when I fell like.

I am using those tutorials:

Learn How To Code a WordPress Theme - Development Tutorial with Bootstrap 4, Underscores & DevWP

How To Install MySQL on Windows 10 (little too long, but lovely and I had fun, worth that time)

It is my blog and I like it so far. Perfect, so much done today and I feel good about it.

Finally I managed to install MySQL (after few times fixing sth, uninstalling and installing again, third time was good one), create database (trying on command line, but finally I found another way in Workbench which worked), create new user - than add entry and add an existing database with changing privileges. I have learned, that "schema" is "database". So create new schema, set schema privilegies and so on. It works! Wow! It took so long and it is done.

Than wordpress instalation on localhost finished succesfully. Eventhough MySQL occupies port 3306, so MAMP took another one. I was worried, but it seems connection works well and database is accesible. Well done :)
