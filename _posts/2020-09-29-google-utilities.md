Useful stuff Google offers:
- PageSpeed Insights
https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/

- Mobile Friendly Test
https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly

Both easy and useful for me, including simple recommendation how to improve and additional recources.

And Google Analytics of course. Tests say only: website works okey, visitors can see it. Analytics say someting more.
