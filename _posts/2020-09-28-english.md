Why in English? Basically, it is all around. Github, tutorials, WordPress, code, everything. Not just that. I like it. I want to practise English. I know it might not be perfect. I am trying to check spelling, but I am not checking grammar. I do my best and I like it. I write all the stuff here for myself. That is it.
