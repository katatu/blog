Hi myself, again. News from Atom Packages, Bootstrap, color picker, bootstrapmade templates, icons, fonts.

* Atom - Packages and comparing files
  * Packages are good and handy
-- to be found in Atom: Packages > Settings View > Install Packages
-- fresh new installed I have "Compare Files" and I am hapy to use it, it works perfect, just as I expected - it compares files and shows the result ;)

HTML + CSS is fine with internet browser

PHP needs server, yaeh, it's server side :) (so I'm using MAMP)

* Bootstrapemade saves time and creates nice templates https://bootstrapmade.com

* Encyklopedies and tutorials I am using at time
  * W3Schools https://www.w3schools.com/ for bootstap especialy, html & css too sometimes 
  * Jak ps√°t web - html, css https://www.jakpsatweb.cz/
  * Codecademy  https://www.codecademy.com/ - still good, good introductions for different topics (few days ago I finished refreshing HTML course, good to resfresh HTML5 structure tags, and continue with PHP)
  * Web developement by Mozilla
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web
Very good source of information

Yesterday great progress was done - I was able to launch the database webside "dogs archive" (for Blanka). I went through Readme and Instructions about setting paths in diverse files and creating new database in phpMyAdmin and import existing template. Good start! I am glad first steps are going well.

I am interested in using server instead of webhosting. How can I mantain it myself? What fo I need? Connection SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).
